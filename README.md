## Project Overview:
Wavecon Telecom, one of the leading telecom providers in India, launched its 5G plans in June 2022, alongside other major telecom companies. The launch was expected to drive significant growth, but instead, Wavecon has seen a decline in active users and slower revenue growth post-launch.

## Problem Statement:
Despite the anticipated benefits of 5G, Wavecon Telecom observed a drop in its active user base and revenue following the rollout. Management is concerned about this decline and needs a detailed analysis to understand the impact of 5G on customer behavior. There is also a desire to evaluate whether internet plans need optimization to regain and increase the active user rate.

## Project Goal:
The primary goal of this project is to create a comprehensive comparison report analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) for both the pre- and post-5G launch periods. This analysis will help identify the reasons behind the decline in performance and highlight areas for improvement. Additionally, the project aims to provide insights on optimizing Wavecon’s internet plans, with the hope of attracting more active users and boosting overall business performance. Ultimately, the analysis will support informed decision-making that can guide the company in reversing its current trends and achieving sustained growth.
